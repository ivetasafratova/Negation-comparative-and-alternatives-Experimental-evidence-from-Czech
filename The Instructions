The instructions for participants were as follows (originally in Czech of course): 

The purpose of the experiment is to determine the acceptability of Czech sentences by Czech native speakers. Rely only on your intuition when assessing grammaticality. It's not about the correctness in the sense of the Czech grammar, but it's about the acceptability in everyday communication. Judge whether the sentences are acceptable and adequate against the given context. Everything will be explained in the next practice part.

The sample practice items are in (1) and (2). The instruction *press 1* means ``yes'' (`the sentence is true and appropriate in the given context'), the instruction *press 2* means ``no'' (`the sentence is not true and appropriate in the given context').

(1) The following sentence (in the given context) is considered false/inappropriate. In this case, press 2.
	(a) Context: Mothers baked delicious birthday's cakes. Three cakes were chocolate, and three cakes were marzipan.
	(b) The sentence: Mothers baked four birthday's cakes together.
  
(2) Please read a slightly different context. In this context, the following sentence probably seems to be true/appropriate. So you should press 1.
	(a) Context: Mothers baked delicious birthday's cakes. Two cakes were chocolate, and two cakes were marzipan.
	(b) The sentence: Mothers baked four birthday's cakes together.
